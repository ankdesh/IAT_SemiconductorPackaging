| ![](./5.png) | Semiconductor packaging is needed to protect the fragile bare die (from foundries like TSMC, Samsung, etc.) from corrosion, moisture, and physical damage, and to provide a means for connecting the die to other dies in the real world|  
| ![](./4.png) | The major trade-offs for choosing right packagiong are : Application (e.g., logic/memory/power), Form factor, Reliability and Durability, Cost, Thermal dissipation, and Pin count (I/O pins).|

| ![](./2.png) | **2D:** Features one or more dies placed side-by-side on an FCBGA substrate, with interconnections primarily in the x-y plane.  **2.1D:** Similar to 2D but includes an RDL (Redistribution Layer). **2.3D:** Stacks multiple dies vertically on an FCBGA substrate, interconnected through the organic interposer. **2.5D:** Uses silicon interposer as an intermediary layer between the dies and the FCBGA substrate, enabling high-density vertical and horizontal interconnects. An example is CoWoS. |
